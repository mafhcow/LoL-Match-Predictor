# LoL-Match-Predictor
An attempt at applying machine learning to predict League of Legends matches.

We are using a dataset of approximately 40k games played on patch 7.24 on ranked summoners rift. The dataset is available at this [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yer2rvrg6j6xhfn/matches.zip?dl=0). Note that this contains the **raw** json files extracted from the Riot API, so uncompressed it is about 1.2 GB.
